anyone manage to solve a captcha in a robot browser with an anti captcha service?
I'm filling the form, clicking play now, the captcha pops up, then I call anticaptchas function to solve, it says its solved but the widget is still there on the page asking to either skip or verify
I tried some bs "fuck captcha" port of stealth captcha
idk if it is doing anything
maybe i need to inject the gcaptcha response somehow
any recommendations for obfuscation?
Gold is already up 15%... I am betting it will hit one dollar 1 mil
> lol gold .53/m
there is currently no solution to bypass incapsulas methods, think of it like cloudflare
almost all profitable botting is based on mass account creation, hence 150k accs banned a day
and 400k usd market cap daily from suciding
the data and models show that...
jagex have an army of chinese and indians manually screening accounts, and several jmods too
they are...
but they work for sub 1usd per hour
and the jmods like weath are on 15k
and have no education higher than highschool
the cutoff for confirmed retard is basically MSc or above
its especially pronounced in a technical area like CS or bot detection
though they had a phd team build their current anti bot
Master of Science
they paid 3rd party team of Phds to build out their dashboards
now indian/chinese/weath operate those dashboards
the back...
the front is trivial
the functionality of the dashboards
its still british run....
they won't say anything bad about china but also won't actively shill for them
possibly to shield it from Chinas anti gambling laws
40m USD... irs come for you at 10k,
The chinese govt has succesfully gone after thousands of illegal gambling operations, even those with western bases. they arrest their employees on soil and put them in labor camps/beat/rape them and freeze the overseas assets (confiscate them). A ton of Australian casinos trying to run jagex style online casinos got caught in 2018
There are a ton of chinese casinos and gamblers using osrs as a casino/chips, if the govt there catch them they will be black bagged. They absolutely do care, the money is enough, but its ideological
any solution to incapsula yet?
plz solution
I have resorted to legacy setup and hacks after three days trying to break it
I have managed to accidentally beat captcha itself saving me a ton on anticaptcha, but my solution is unstable and I have no real way around incapsula with a stable solution
> You didn’t beat captcha, they just removed it from the acc creation unless jagex doesn’t like you
you could in theory do 100b a day because there is infinite water and infinite jugs, but you would probably get your mules banned after they trace the entity poisions
My normal method was trigging captcha 100% of the time, and I was running it throughh anticaptcha
making by hand triggers captcha after 50 or so accounts
my new method is doing several thousand a day without a single captcha
try jugs on a pvp world with 100 or so accounts....
> You should find a discord targeted to bot farms, this is more for reverse engineering
reverse engineering is not limited to cs100 java
incapsula is owned by imperva, an anti ddos firm...
they have hundreds of layers across different products, incapsula is a suite of some of them, any whatever jagex has is a custom implementation
they also probably ganked the roll out according to their company rep I spoke to
incap are probably taking over or have taken over the world server protection too
how does this farm work? isn't there a 25 drop item limit?
what break pattern for passing that trade restriction?
it seems likely jagex have a flag for excessive play hours... and almost all suicide accounts run indefinitely
If OSBOT in headless mode is still "rendering" or computing the game environment, is there a way to screen shot this...even whilst its headless?
I did and they don't know
its a lower level problem
well the data is being rendered somehow, so it exists fora  moment, it must be technically possible to screen shot it, or take the pixel data in binary and render that or just interpret the raw binary pixel values
discord forces me to make a new account every time I close it
when i close it im not logged in and it asks fora  new account and registration
I can't
see thats why they all have the same username...
right now I even have 4 discord tabs open and each one is a different account
anyone got a working snippet to create a websocket server in intellij java?
I have kind of done this part now, but how to integrate the client part with java/OSBOT?
can anyone help, I'm trying to sort the dictionary, but it will only sort by one side no matter which values I swap around
like where it says math.floor... this side wont be sorted, but the other side will
so the values/keys are sorted according to the other side, but not the math.floor side which is what I want
I add two readings from the loop, then they are paired by adding to a dictionary
then I want to sort them by one column, but for somereason it only ever sorts the wrong side
yes in that part
they need to be in a dictionary, because each value corresponds to its pair, and sorting will jumble those pairs instead of preserving them
but if I swap their positions when adding to the dictionary, it still doesn't work
maybe thats it
even casting the undesired to int and the desired to str it still doesn't sort the desired
and swapping their position when adding to keys/values
103954: 832, 120031: 637, 120056: 825, 119754: 521, 119847: 1398, 119817: 613, 119830: 514, 119833: 553, 119965: 504, 119918: 504, 120101: 448
as the dictionary
and i need to sort it by the 3 digit values
its still not working lol
that small example works
but then it must be the way that I am adding them or something earlier in the code
> what about `y = {k:v for k,v in sorted(list(x.items()), key = lambda v: v[1])}`
matlab is top tier for advanced programming/analysis
in 48h non stop coding i've managed to get OSbot to connect to a python server socket and then disconnect. Anyone know how I can get it to send information too? like text/values
basically my headless farm sometimes has problems, so I want to be able to check them and prune, debug with the sockets
at the moment I'm blind looking at WMI memory values and cpu cycles
everything online is deprecated, or doesn't work, its strange the osbot devs didn't build something like it into the client itself
I'm getting pretty close, I've had to write a bunch of hacks for the deprecated socket code and use python to handle the server
The problem is because I need to run them in headless mode... also its  not botting if you're looking at the screen
I hacked this into receiving a message, but now it wont send one back to the client
also should I have a thread constantly running to listen always for socket messages on the client? this seems pretty heavy...? or just poll the server periodically?
I wanted to see if it was true or not
or what it was doing
there are no working libraries for what I'm trying to do
why json?
wmi is already integrated into my multi server solution
> That's what I'm saying. He doesn't know how to send data over socketsl, and says theres no libraries for it. Definitely need to take a step back and go learn about socket programming first. Hell, you could even use web sockets and the many libraries for that
the syntax you gave me doesnt parse
if my server is external, and I can see and issue commands, and the bots and legion and headless, should the bots be constantly listening for server commands? is the only way to do this with an extra thread?
there is a client function? I see that the server is ok with listening
> i guess you're talking about bots that is in java language, then you should get input stream from socket and read that data.
i'm wondering if there is a way to constantly read or be alert, ideally without another java thread
second class
> im not reading ur code
all are broken/deprecated/incompatible
the socket diagram is pretty intuitive
its the data types that dont have libraries etc
no one in OSBOT would take 200m osrs to do what I was asking
> @sarahpeterson dont copy/paste them and expect them to work, understand what the snippets do and apply it to your code
my code base is already very extensive...
100k + lines
I've been using python WMI to externally handle communication by trying to guess the headless bots activities by profiling the jvm
now with sockts I can eventually ask him exactly what hes doing
I am also still partially relying on text files for logs and some parameters, which I would like to migrate eventually to dataframes and possibly a database, then I can automatically run linear programming on it
what buzzwords... those are pretty standard
I've been generating a ton of data with my farm but storing it in plaintext, and haven't had time to plot it
linear programming is ML
I have a plan for a ML bot though, that self learns, and uses a drift diffusion model for activity selection, and a hippocampal grid cell model for navigation and exploration
I want to create base classes for every possible interaction, then iterate over them then have the bots state generate an error signal for back prop
I will use the osbot api too, so for example to loop though every widget, and then take the non null and adjust the NN weights
the non null widget
against all of the other possible widgets
say there are 255 widgets, and I find the one that isn't null, I can back prop that and adjust the search tree NN so he moves that widget higher in the list
it will eventually learn which widget to expect
Me too sort of
I think there is a minimum number of nodes in your NN based on the input size, and really osrs doesn't have that many options for dialog/menu/interactions/object names
you will get caught by jagex and banned
the NN will approach AGI and be undetectable
with enough epochs jagex will classify your deterministic bot
and it won't ever pass the turing test of a jmod personally watching your screen for an hour
your bots also dont have a language model
I've had great success with a classical language model
a j mod investigating you might
they probably know you're botting but so many are that they need to allow you to
they just keep tabs to see you don't make too much noise, or gold,
only really serious farmers get targeted for bans
after the rev farming /venezuelan wall is gold going back up?
attaching a profiler to OSBOT jar? why isn't it visible here but jagexlauncher is
no thats the original client I happen to have open, I checked its pid
I've managed to attach
what should I look for to find memory leaks/problems?
> extremely unlikely that it's his script, unless he's holding millions of unused references
from jprofiler
oh wow these options seem new updates
> @sarahpeterson Are you using 64-bit java or 32-bit java? Moving to 64-bit for me significantly dropped ram usage. Here is where you can get 32-bit Java 11 
> does anyone here know their shit when it comes to statistics?
or hover over it and alt enter, then select import etc
there is an option to import on the fly or something, might help
can try to add more memory, allow it to use more
ok so I was right, jagex confirm themselves they use entity poisions 
At about 3:30 he says the anti cheat team told him they "set something up here" to detect new bots in that specific region
which I think is flagging the entity on n interactions, so its "poisoned" just like certain water sources
he has shut down at least one of my farms in the past
> Okay so let me get this right. Jagex bit detection is nothing more than a bunch of handwritten rules that flag accounts for manual review.
I saw on the bot busting they were looking at heat maps of the world map and account density
I think it might have even been across every world, so you can see lots of accounts in one area
> @sarahpeterson i think it's not like `n interations` but like transparent NPCs or something
you would see if they were disabling entities to trick you
and it would only work on monsters that move around... 99% of skills have static objects
> I assume they have SQL queries that they run daily
I've yet to see anyone bot 24h on a new account and not get banned at 7am
is there a way to make java only run on my first 22 cores so that I have some free for multi tasking? I have an option to set affinity in windows but it seems on a per .jar process
I've lowered the clock from 4.8 max to 3.5 which is its stock, and capped the turbo to very very low, and I'm still at 80 degrees and 95% cpu, I've undervolted too -80mv. Anyone got any ideas to get it lower? It has a h60i AIO water cooler and 2x noctura 120mm/140mm fans. If I uncap the turbo or use the default clock it will 110 degrees and t junction
I will buy some of this now, thanks
I did clean some dust and got -10 degrees but still its bios/idle temps are 70 degrees
can anyone explain why server cpus seem so overpriced and poorer performance than regular desktop ones?
is it ever cheaper to buy a server to bot osrs than to use a desktop?
amd is a cheap knockoff
yes
I am about to buy lifetime membership too
what features justify that 5x price increase...? the clock speed is lower, lower pci slots, etc higher power usage.... what on earth more is there?
in the comparison i posted, that is slower, and still costs more to use, same year and nearly quarter release date too
more cores... but you could buy 5x 12 cores for the price of one 18...
How many accounts running on that IP? they sweep from the top down... if you're running sub 10-30 they usually let you pass
they pull an sql table with accounts per ip
then go from the top down, table sorted
the same for new accounts created and playtime
50 is near the bottom of the list
the guy usually does a 1h check
he has to hit 50-100k bans  in that time
sometimes they double check, and if they are working crunch time they will do every 2h till 17:00 GMT
its also possible you've been flagged and all are marked for ban, you're just looking at delays to obfuscate their methods
they said they plug some flags/heuristics in and that builds their chainban protocol
they also said they delay bans too... so two and two
it would be much easier to backprop your parameters and reverse engineer their detection vectors if they banned 100%
pulling a table of data they already have of accounts playing time is the most lowjack thing possible
and yet can detect 99% of bots
anyone got a new selenium/chrome fix for the imperva update?
can anyone help avoid selenium getting blocked by incapsula the moment you try to create an account?
yes but how
still getting instantly detected
sometimes I think I managed to set some cookies/referers by browsing google manually first, but then it catches me when I submit the form
yes, 10h +
yes thats where I got all of those from
it blocks at max resolution too
and non incognito
and if I navigate to runescape.com then have selenium click the new account button from there
incapsula uses fingerprinting
they have recently ramped up their system too, it looks like it was expensive
they're 100% detecting my browser is selenium driven too
I tried a python lib for that and it failed
i found a 3 year old one but in the comments they say its deprecated
this one fails too, gets detected
I will give you mine if you help me bypass selenium detection
anyone good with technical high iq stuff could have a look here and see if they can figure out how jagex are blocking account creation 
what is this, I've seen it in the console. And lots of people share things in the community, github is billions of lines of code shared by experts for example
30k accs is pretty low
I'm running at capacity, but i'm using a really lowjack two step solution
its from my legacy system when I was developing the previously working selenium solution
I'm really curious as to how they are detecting selenium too, many people say they fingerprinted their own browsers, and they show the same as chrome, yet incapsula still detects
Ok so with my hotloaded selenium chrome driver, and a fresh IP I didn't trigger the incapsula block on the first load, I made three accounts manually without triggering
then I tried to send the driver.get(url) and this triggered incapsula and perma banned
I'm thinking I'm IP range flagged, and also wondering about ip ranges, how many unique IPs am I likely to go through before repeating in a normal western mainstream ISP as I force it to change? there are 1000s in my range? millions? I've at least managed to be partially range banned by one major site I was botting but still a few ips I got still worked
I think they have flagged my email address I've been using
seems strange, maybe jagex asked them to
I've just changed my ip and it seems fine without that email being sent but I need more testing
I've been using the same email for a very large number of accounts, I think they've put a block on it or a flag
also they're detecting my selenium entering text into a single field, maybe its typing the characters too fast
this is a new update it seems
nop
I am surprised jagex are targeting me so hard
yet there is a constant wall of pyramid plunder bots 24/7
the farms in puggers latest video have weeks play time at least and 10 accounts every world... 3k bots non stop and in plain sight
maybe if enough people report problems with it they will relax the rules, the replier isnt a jmod so he probably doesn't realise its intentional anti bot/ddos
is there a way to actually calculate the real volume of an osrs item? The GE appears to show both buy and sell counts, so anyone flipping an item for a few gp will inflate the volume....
like if 1m sharks are fished in a day, but some guys buy them all and resell them 3x over the volume shows 4m
The GE is just showing "amount traded" on the website... not whether they were bought or sold
is there a 3rd party site that can track it?
if one shark is sold to timmy, and timmy sells that shark on the same day to bob, then bob sells that shark to alice on the same day too then the amount traded shows 4 sharks sold
how do we know how many sharks were entered into the total volume
instead of just being passed around
is there an econ way to estimate it?
hmm actually I guess you could buy an entire days volume
for vastly over the market price and see when it runs out
then hold those positions for the next day
you would get a good estimate, even just one hour of organic selling could be used to estimate it, or just hold long enough to buy out the merchants reserves
doesn't this also still double count for merchers...
in java is it better to have a second thread constantly running or to call it to start just before its needed then terminate it afterwards? Will I experience performance problems constantly stopping and starting a second thread?
by averaging it over time
hoarding wouldn't affect the volume over the really long term
since they would eventually have to feed it back in
if they keep it forever then its meaningless anyway
still no public solution
few of the farm managers claim to have one but no proof
yes imperva has detected chromes selenium
they are also flagging/fingerprinting your inputs
so randomise those too
they flag and tag IP's also and pass to jagex for Acc tracing also
I've seen that and tested a bunch of patched drivers, and even manually edited the source code of the driver
I have noticed when it flags and blocks you even on a legit browser, that clearing the cookies /cache in that scenario unblocks
in my latest try at cracking selenium detection, on a fresh IP. It seems the browser isn't being detected until you use the driver
if you make a single call it looks like that is detected, even just reading the email fields address but not entering anything
they seem to have me in an infinite loop on a forum link too on the flagged browser
a few times my captcha workers reported infinite captchas too >5 attempts
I think also by trying to get to other pages where you can login, that those are also flagged by anti bot/ddos/spam
seems like they have in one go blocked the people automating account locks but also automated account creation too
ideas what to set here?
would it be beneficial to say force clients to run on a single core?
I've added those exact exceptions to the method at the top
yet its trying to force me to surround this particular line with try/catch also
the exceptions it wants me to add are both already in the class and that method too
I also can't add the surround trycatch because it will break the conditional sleep
it does this to the method, breaking it
any ideas?
Thanks, I've basically solved it by keeping the throw catch and adding a return null, hopefully its meaningless since it will never interrupt anyway
"doesn’t list those checked exceptions"
does this mean there is somewhere a method I can add the exceptions to
the exception is because that method might initiate a file reading
well call something else that will read a file
ty
the idea that you get flagged and banned by an entirely automated system when your bot gets "stuck".... what would they be looking for? in activity? are they somehow logging really repetitive actions like the instruction to the client is the same 1000x in a row?
there is a sleep method built in, but thats a snippet that provides conditional sleeps, so you can sleep until not animating etc
it allows to set the polling interval too, great for lowing cpu during sleep
when I call this and the path is unreachable it throws my script into some kind of infinite fail loop and won't pass it
any ideas?
after the game update, sometimes osbot can't load:
Can any one explain why this happens?
it's trying to inject something that has moved position?
is there a way to detect failed hooks in a jvm?
like by attaching a debugger or something
is there a python library to send fake mouse movements/keyboard events to a window without running a VM?
has jagex/imperva range banned/flagged all tor ips?
even running a tor ip under my "undetected chrome" still gets flagged
I could try a thousand and change my settings/options to check whats triggering
is it still possible to do some stuff like tick manipulation, spamming object interactions faster than you're supposed to?
I did once, I will again at some point
I've found this on the acc create page
I'm wondering if its used for detection, or its just standard to allow different devices to navigate the page
"/**
and even run macros and instantly fill text boxes
but if I use selenium it flags me
the base selenium is instant on a clean ip
if I add all the usual options and driver mods, google bot header etc then I can fool it until the driver interacts with the page
I'm running it through a test suite now with a million proxies
I think they have the tor range on file
I can also use a computer vision bot but its buggy sometimes and I have to keep recapturing the error messages
when I have time I will write a full powered OpenCV account creator I think
hmm what about injecting javascript to fill the form with selenium
varrok west logs are poisoned btw
heads up
all the oaks every world are dead
less than 30 logs and ban
there are normally 50 + players at every f2p oak/log spot
there are two who claim to have one but there is no proof it works and they are behind paywalls
this is still not proof that either of us have cracked it
anti captcha spendings on geetests
you will hit one every 10-20 accounts typically even doing by hand
yes
never seen a geeTest before until that recent update
there is no way its more secure than captcha, but imperva have it integrated with their fingerprinting
I think they forced jagex to change to it, but in the long run its a wrong move because you can openCV geeTest
there is no known CV captcha solution
with >70% success
they will also geeTest
two years ago there was a public working Geetest CV
are jagex tracking you across machines?
like if you login on a client on one machine, then another, they are detecting it? even on the same ip
can anyone write javascript? I think an account creator can be made entirely in javascript
if(document.getElementById('create-submit') !=null){
the top two fields user and password can be filled by js too
it just needs a sleep and to be able to loop, looping in chome dev tools seems to crash me though/unsupported
seems strange they would block selenium...but allow virtually the same element interaction with js
anyone recommend a huge free proxy list?
impossible with public algorithms
anyone know if its possible to use requests/python to load webpages with a sock5 proxy?
thanks, I've been using this syntax and another option too but both still don't let me load a page or make a request with the socks5 proxy
I'm wondering if socks5 proxies cannot support http requests
I got incapsula blocked on one of my servers creating accounts in a clean legit browser
I cleared private data, relaunched the standard chrome browser, got a fresh clean residential from my legit ISP and was still getting instant block
only running incognito managed to bypass it... how is that finger printing possible?
are there some clients/vectors that are able to bot with non socks5 proxies, like http etc?
or there is something about the java client base that all proxies (except "packet bots") need socks5?
ty
anyone know what's going on in this call "java -cp "lib/*" org.osbot.Boot -debug" in a batch file
I think its not finding the osbot.jar in that same folder
because taking it out makes no difference to the error
thanks, I'm using this guide 
and it says just to make a folder on the desktop and add the osbot jar, the sql driver
then make a bat file with that command
yes
still nothing
but I tried replacing the java path with the path to osbot and it launched
but the test script won't find the driver
so probably that hasn't worked
java.sql.SQLException: No suitable driver found for jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/big_league?useUnicode=true&useJDBCCompliantTimezoneShift=true&useLegacyDatetimeCode=false&serverTimezone=UTC
it was actually that I didn't have the path set right
thanks
now I am crashing osbot client out with
any ideas whats going on?
yes OSBOT, and I've hit that permissions before, but i've put the library in the data folder, and also the guide i am following is on the OSBOT website, and many people there report it working back in 2018
it is all caps officially
does org.osbot.tA.checkPermission(lz:181) mean that osbot is actively blocking it
hey so I got a script working that can post/get request my webapp server in flask
my plan is to read that line there, the end of the url and parse it into the parameters I want to enter into sqlite
how do I read that text... ? something internal to flask is printing it out but I can't figure out what so I can print it and handle it myself
yes
the highlighted string
I'm also sure this is a hack way of connecting bot>sql but it should work
ok but how do I make flask read that...?
@app.route('/',methods = ['POST', 'GET'])
this needs to go in my java url?
ok so if I wanted to write stuff in there to pass... it wont work because id need to have a path with that already there?
the server can read whatever I am sending it
I just need to parse those strings surely
the data I want to write can be all contained in a single string
then parsed with python
and inserted into sql
for me the simpler and quicker the better
posting to this String url = "";
should be read by :@app.route('/',methods = ['POST', 'GET'])
it does nothing either way
whether I put all that url or just a /
ok I managed to get it to print hello world
I am listening
I think its broken where I write the post data in java
the copy paste I found isn't being registered by the flask server
so far only getting a status code has worked
do I just need a generic POST ...?
yes
I think this needs to be used to write the post form
I have done it now, thanks anyway
well just now after fixing some parsing errors I have successfully sent my username + world to my SQL server and had it generate a unique ID primary key and timestamp for the entry
I want to make two tables, one to monitor online accounts, and another for mass logging parameters etc so I can run datasci/ML models on it
I am wondering I suppose I should use update for the online acc tracker
and try to generate a unique identifier for the account, so I can remove his record if he gets banned
or maybe use his username
I make the http post request, then parse the dictionary and generate an SQL statement that is trigged on receiving a post in flask
maybe I will create a procedure and if he hasn't been updated after 1-2h then remove/mark dead
Well I need to have the client post to the database, I was thinking once an hour was good enough
and just to make sure I don't delete a guy who is online, wait and check every 2h
It was difficult, months ago I tried to get sockets to work but failed, yesterday I tried with apache/xaamp and mysql but I couldn't get it to work, osbot guys say the permission isn't blocked but I gave up
writing log data every 3 minutes seems pretty intense, one of my basic text logging has a short interval
at some point I will try and learn something from it
I know how what to do... its just getting the syntax right
I know what the path is
but not how to read/write to flask with it
thats just a syntax/api problem
theory>everything else
architects are more important than brick layers
an architect can design a palace, but not know how to lay individual pipes
theory is much more important
well no, he will pass the specification on to a pipe specialist who knows the piping syntax
the president of the USA has 3,000,000 people working under him
its unrealistic to expect him to know exactly how to do every departments work
I have actually built the working system... it just took a while because I'm new to flask/web server apis and the syntax for sqlite
now I am integrating it into my bot
I have a log file with  timestamps, then each account online per line in a text file
like 2021-04-05 22:57:59
then acc
then acc
then the 2021-04-05 22:58:60
yes but this is the data I logged from the past year or so
before I made that database
I read it into a list
but there is a logic problem, I want to count the number of lines inbetween each date/timestamp
so I get a tuple, with a datetime stamp and the number of lines that was between that and the previous
I think I can loop over each entry and mark the index of the timestamps
then calculate the difference between the current index and the next index marked, then write the stamp at the index and the difference into a tuple
then I could feed the tuples into a time series NN
the datetime in this particular log isn't attached to specific accounts
it more a track of farm size over days and months
by the interval my manager polls the servers
I also have individual timestamps and logs for accounts
how can I display large numbers of points
I don't really want to average because it will lose a lot of the data
can anyone give me a rough idea of how intensive http requests are, say if you have many clients making requests over the same network... when would it start to be a problem? and how about a web server, I am using a flask which warns "not for production"...
hardware/resource intensive
at what rate is a home solution going to start having problems
with i/o
100 or so requests at minute level intervals... is this high usage? Do webservers like flask auto handle requests like that from so many
when would it start to be a problem for a domestic user?
but at what volume of requests
?
even long response times are fine for my usage
also when would you expect high resource usage from high volume requests, like cpu util/ram/i/o
bandwith on local net is 1gbps.....
the router has a limit
and the cables
multi threadding in python isn't real
and my solution is in python
there is no real way to make 100 req a second in python
python threadding isn't real
had a call from ibm earlier
a url string with sql entry values
its all local
a few servers
but one router
I needed to write out from osbot
and they have many restrictions
so flask server was working
with apache and postres sql it seemed blocked
I hit permission errors in log
also. I have a strange problem
I am teamviewering into a remote machine, physical and running a macro on it
but when I close teamviewer it is breaking my macro, it runs but no longer registers the windows env
I tried to run the macro, compiling it to an exe, then subprocessing it in python
but this fails
I am basically running an account creator with the aid of a macro on a remote machine
but it breaks if I close teamviewer, and terminates if I end a RDP
is there a solution short of writing out a full pyautogui and subprocess piping that to the machine?
windows
on all machines
on teamviewer sometimes I can keep it active
as a workaround, but if I get Ip range banned/blocked and need to reconfigure my machine then I have problems again
rdp does all sorts of things when you close/exit that teamviewer doesn't and vnc viewer needs to be configured
osbot is great
most of the dev upkeep is outsourced
In the first month or two I cleared the lifetime sponsor fee
also is there a public incapsual crack/fix
?
there is a guy on github maintaining undetected chromedriver, but he is still detected by osrs's incapsula flavour
but somehow not by impervas home domain
you can write scripts to automatically monitor and handle your bots
you should have the bots deployed then a central executive function that manages them at a high level
then if that hits an exception it will notify you by email
if you code that in python its quite easy to reply to the email and have the exec function parse your email and perform specific subroutines to fix those problems it couldn't auto handle
your email is likely already linked to your mobile/smart watch and other devices
there are lots more fields and timestap/data that you can use too
you can even send patching instructions through email to your bot manager to have it patch and recompile a script with a snippet
can anyone advise, I'm trying to run analysis on a log file, its a long list of entries separated by line: with a timedate stamp at the top:
like this: timedate
accname
acc name
etc...
timedate
I want to run a loop to count those inbetween each timedate
and also does anyone know a way to easily plot 500k points on a plot in python
actually about 10,000
with a time series, so they will be marked using that standard timedate stamp  like 2021-04-23 04:34:14
for the first part, I basically need to count the number of elements inbetween two delimiter elements in an array
I think I can loop over the array and increment a counter if the value is not equal to the delimiter, then if it is, store that value in a new array that stores the counts
ok so I should store this count with a tuple of the time stamp
how to plot this time sieries?
nvm think I have done it
my flask server is listening on my local machine where its hosted on 
on my remote servers trying to connect through that is failing, of course because its running here locally
is there an obvious way to have them all connect to the same?
nvm solved by setting flask to listen on 0.0.0.0 and connecting to my localmachines ip
is there any point to registering accounts?
also jagex wiped 1k + of my accounts that haven't been logged in
someone has manually looked at them and chain banned them for being created
anyone got any data/insight into clicking verify in the email you get when you create an account?
I'm trying to setup discord webhooks and its throwing "java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/json/JSONObject
i'm in intellij and the json library is added to the project already
how to add this in intellij?
no just default intellij
runtime
neither
just intellij
in this a guy shows manually extracting the classes from json library
I think I need to do something similar but with intellij
so i should add that jar as a library and dependency in intellij project structure?
thanks, seems like dragging and dropping worked
what are most all in one farm managers written in?
can you get your bots to read discord messages/instructions
also is there a basic guide and open source /skeleton for building your own client?
LINK?
whats your github?
does anyone know what encoding jagex uses for their strings in interfaces?
I notice I can't read in numbers, but with utf 8 I can get better results
its still missing a ton of information though
using osbots .getmessage from the widget
when i write that string to the log it prints perfectly in the client
when I try and send it via discord webooks
its scrammbled
and looks like its not properly encoded
writing with osbots default log
I think its a wrapper for sys out
if (MethodProvider.getWidgets().get(383, 3, i).getMessage() != null) {
now this toSave variable
is scrammbled when sending
but it prints fine in the log
that code is reading widget text into a variable
in osbot its log(toSave)
i think log is just a sys out wrapper for osbots client
thats to send to discord
so maybe its where the encoding is failing
it was in particular omitting line spaces, and numbers
I think I need to force the variable to utf8 somewhere in the discord snippet
where do I set the encoding? in the IDE? on the script?
BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(con.getOutputStream()), Charset.forName("UTF8")));
aha
thanks
there is no known selenium crack, but it is possible to crack their overall solution, there was also a bruteforce way of rotating through proxies and firing one request from each
they are detecting all selenium drivers and puppeteer when they execute on the page, also in combination with fingerprinting/cookies
in the past some said that it was needed to properly handle the cookie they set but I think it's still blocked
last time I tried this and the other incapsula crackers they all failed on the RS website, possible they have a custom solution. Also requests seem to get detected and blocked also
When they first threw up incapsula it would only detect requests/selenium after the first request/account created
then flag your ip and auto block on all
so you could rotate through proxies and hit with a fresh request each time
I have since cracked it but can't share except for a large amount of osrs gold or something because it took me months
there is also no other public solution
some bot farms claim to have an integrated working solution but idk
make an offer
I'm trying to add elements from a list to another list
res = null;
on a list operation...
I think targetItems.add(res.get(i));
as far as I know I have an array list of strings....
and I'm trying to add each one one by one to a new array
In python I would just use "list"
but in java I am guessing the array type
because there are many
I didn't copy...
I wrote as I would in python
then adjust the syntax
I'm 99% its taht line I posted
because it prints MethodProvider.log("Adding first res item");
targetItems.add(res.get(i));
res is just a list of strings
I split a complete string by the newline char
then store in a string list
then iterate over those
it is "null"
but the string null
which its supposed to be
the first two elements are strings of the text "null"
but thats ok
some of the string elements are the plaintext null
they should be able to be appended to the list...
unless "null" is a keyword or something in java
"null" is just a string
like "fdsfds"
in this context
not the null like normal in java
the ide made me initialise that list as null
aha
in python to init a list...
newlist()
or interpreted
with no init
yes Ik, thanks
it works now
it was that I initialised the list by making the list null
then tried to add something to it
most languages you initialise it so its ready to be appended to so its faster
also does anyone have a skeleton/starter kit for an opensource bot client?
but these are just clients... for playing
I am looking for full access/modding on the source code
mixin?
is that c++ client out and opened up?
it was 1+ year of a datascience project
and I didn't claim to have completely reversed it
just extracted some actionable insights
and modelled it
at abstraction
professional
yes for my bot farm
opencv is really compute intensive and unreliable
I am thinking the solution is to log interactions
and feed them into a probabilistic optimisation system, a kind of wide neural network
so the final bot can read the input vector of entity states determined by pixels from a single image and return click positions
client detection isn't the final problem
ultimately you will need to mimic the human interaction to fool even manual reviews
this kind of complex function could be captured by neural network model
an undetected client will still be banned by the human team they have
they could table join based on your interacts and account creation date
that would pull your accounts even though you made them on proxies
well if you made the accounts 1 month apart then it wouldn't
they regularly ban 1000s of my accounts that have never been logged in
through profiling
and a guy manually using his neocortex module
maybe if you're really staggering them and spreading across a wide proxy base
at a cost I presume, some rotational/residential proxy service
for me its not worth single account tests
my models give insights to things like that
on a fresh residential and sleep schedule on a clean profile ...
there are plenty of long term osbot users
yes
its possible and probably that jagex let plenty of botters fly to obfuscate/apathy/ROI
but the sheer number of long term osbot users suggests client detection isn't the probelm
you would see users collectively correlate on the forums/ircs too
I tried a few clients but osbot was the best and best API
support has also been great
appeal to the masses*
ad populum
but also mathematica
since their reports /testimony can be correlated
there are 1000s of osbot users who report long term use with no bans..
I directly feed my logs back into my solution
my ROI continues to improve
I have several end to end and a few looped datascience solutions based on my insight
Yes I am formally trained in the scientific method
in 2016 they hired a fresh phd in computational biology to implement ML methods
I estimate it was a mid tier solution, more exploratory research
but it signals the start of more AI heavy methods
and the direct sourcing of high tier math talent
the ambiguity can be resolved by rudimentary ML methods
basic signal detection theory
the new player to the game notices something is not right with the bots
he can intuit
the brain will pattern detect on those bots
if even new players can detect it you will produce reliable and detectable signals
osbot at least somewhat randomizes the camera movement, and there is easy scope to obfuscate it
there are some interactions that are impossible based on vanilla client, its possible he was using one of those interacts which suggests non jagex client + unfair mod
there are functionally true random solutions
and functions that cannot be reversed without supercomputing to produce good randomness
biometrics are largely normally distributed
they are not random...
the random component can be pulled from a randomness API
some radioactive decaying isotope in a locked box outputting 0/1
or from a computationally intractable function
to model human behaviour the normal distrib is nearly perfect
for most
for the extra parameters those can be well modellled too
we actually have good andromorphic data from UI design firms
for an endgame solution it does
if you are 3h suicide botting then profiling and ml models doesn't matter so much
if you are trying to pass human inspection on a bought/sold acc maxed etc then it will
they can call all sorts of bespoke heuristics and models on your account if the indian checking it isn't sure
there is low level ml on new accounts
my model data suggests a 3rd world external solution
like mech tuck but I suspect with a real office or remote teach
team*
by timezones too
the game produces interactions, the noise and delays are captured by ml models...
yes
anti bot goes beyond software model implementations, down to operational features
who is running the model, when are they running sql queries etc
would x person implement y feature or weight z feature heavily
data modelling jagex employees
thiss is the first 3000 records from 500,000
the guys who ran the 2020 dupes checked discord for awake mods
can you see a pattern?
its a multivariate complex function, but the point is that you can see with your limited brain regularity
and so a rudimentary algo will see it too
this is in general jagex anti cheat team behaviour modelling
and you can see regularity
in a graph
its not necessary to leak my IP
only to demonstrate that their behaviour is regular
on some set of features
its not a sign of shame to realise that you don't immediately understand everything thats going on
domain expertise requires expertise and time spent in a domain
yes I can see its increasing linearly
a function could be easily approximated
xpgain = f(x+p)
by looking at its graphical representattion
what if each letter in your message is cyphered .... well it could be
but statisticians have standards
that function was linearly increasing
according to standards
to label them would leak my ip and method
I was illustrating the point
of data quality
and potential for inference
the data at least shows regularity
functions can be defined
behaviour profiled
if your data looked like this
you might have many problems
trying to define a function that wasn't just noise generation
even here with no labels
you can understand whats going on
and realise that the function is at least potentially real
compare that to 
a real linear function isn't a perfect straight line
on real data
life expectancy is linear
but plotted on real data its not a straight line
I have millions of data points
much of the data is fed back into my solution
it is part of the IP of my solution, so its understandable not to release it
it is a model.... it captures the data, of course with error margins
client detection is assigned a probability and fed into the model
yes it directly increases my ROI
in a naturalistic design model you're permitted to use naturally occurring control groups
take for example jagex admitting to finding several botted accounts at 200m xp
the data is directly fed back into my solution in an online learning paradigm
its not distributed yet, I am writing the NN code for that
it runs through a series of finite state machines, akin to boosted trees
and adjusts the decision making/executive function module of my solution through parameter tweaks
eventually it will input raw data into an online NN model
the model will then "blackbox compute" the resultant parameters
that will be fed into the topdown control system
have you sampled gtp3... even the full model is immediately obviously non human
it can't keep on topic for >3 outputs
IQ gap
a few below the norm would make me sub 65
unable to use a pencil
iq is the most robust statistic measure of a psychometric function discovered and modelled in human history
130 is 2%
but social circles and professional networks self segregate
mensa have just a small % of the whole high iq community
at base entry like 125 your other factors take precedence, like experience, domain knowledge etc
there are 10s of millions of 140IQ people in the 3rd world doing absolutely nothing
it is
its the best most perfect measure we have ever found
you can predict net worth at 50 by IQ measured at 16 through standardized national testing
to an incredibly high degree
the data is in, check the sweedish data where they track 90+% of men from age 16 through to middle age
I was googling for 1+h
the first search has 0 results also
I think I figured it out
is there an easy way to try and call a function and timeout? and pass after some time?
how far does the osrs tile space reach across?
is it 18 tiles from diagonal to diagonal?
maximum reachable tiles
I am using osbots walking, but I need the maximum , I think its 20 and -20 or so
the area that is visible
I am beginning to write my automata experiments
first I want it over exploration, then over all possible entity interactions
I need a distribution to pass the random increments to the position generation so I don't get stuck walking in circles
I'm trying to find the nearest non null object, I guess I need a lambda statement RS2Object miscObject = MethodProvider.getObjects().closest((n)-> {n !=null});;
is there an obvious way to find all visible entities on screen?
RS2Object miscObject = MethodProvider.getObjects().closest(o -> o != null );
I want it to search for objects with no criteria
it always returns null objects
they recommend wrapping almost everything with a nullcheck
ah thanks
I guess this will return the array I need
there are millions of pages of the api... I try to google first
I was looking here 
I guess I needed objects
My automata should be able to explore all game times, then interact with all entites, with all inventory objects, and all widget options
with that it would be able to complete all game tasks?
all game tiles*
then perhaps I can extract some loss function and perform RL
my walking explorer is very short, the rest will just be less than 50 lines each
.getActions() returns me a single string...
instead of a collection or array list
are objects hardcoded with sets of interactions?
ah
tryign to log it shows : [Ljava.lang.String;@297a562
ty
its not obvious that "[Ljava.lang.String" is an array...
I suppose yes
but thats not what the log says
aha
I think now it can explore in a particular direction
and not backtrack as much
its an array in matlab and python too
but when you print to console it shows [Ljava.lang.String;@286c4f20
I'm coding basically one of these 
but with entity exploration too
if I can add an RL algorithm and record its states/game states I can approach an AGI algorithm
I am doing research
AGI research
and also anti bot modelling
the behaviour of the bot shouldn't be predictable or profileable
at a certain depth of the finite state machines
iterating over all possible states
at a glance, already my agent appears to be displaying "noob" like behaviour
where he is exploring the early map
if there are parameters or "weights" that bias the state machines to fall into particular states based on learnt/previous knowledge then no
AGI
not AI
bot detection is looking for non human intelligence
AGI should converge on human level intelligence
and simulate it
I have modelling data and inference
they have a good false positive rate
so simulating a human playing is a viable solution
the human runs a biological neural network
and has some AGI algorithm running on its neocortex
it has some inputs too from the environment
you know how to order a cheese burger
but if I ask you to order it in chinese
semantics are much more important than syntax
human level general intelligence
well they are differentiating humans from bots
my PCA shows SQL table lookups
basic quieries
then heuristics
then some ML models
then having humans manually review
return confidence values of bot/not bot
classification problem
well so at about 6am GMT they pull a sql table and pull accounts created <24hours and sort by ips per account
then check for a flag on previous IP ban and sort
this is the first leg of the ban wave that sweeps at 7am GMT
its a multi tiered longitudinal datascience project
its quite complicated, modelling of complex human behaviour
you need to build a network of data points etc
assign probabilities over hypothesis spaces
so there are a finite number of technological solutions
you need to search that space
yes so SQL is one of the options
then you feed data and knowledge into graphs
and as you accumulate evidence
your model outputs confidence intervals over solutions in the hypothesis space
my models output sql as most probable
ergo I have confidence in it
well they could be using notepad ++
or matlab...
if it helps, one of the research methods I used was to compile details on the background and expertise of their employees publicly available
for example one I linked here lists the specific methods in her datascience projects at jagex
its more likely a few dashboards a guy built a few years ago that have daily readouts of those sql tables
then gives the ability to manually write queries, though nothing too complex
I am running a holistic approach, so many forms of data/evidence
No its for my bot farm
I outsource client maintenance to osbot
they patch the hooks and upgrade the API etc
that frees me to work on the high level problems
No I am a sponsor
its part of a larger AGI research project
to produce AGI
?
there is a built in turing test and  an aggressive human check on bots in osrs
I would have to write my own turing tests and create a complex environment etc in unity, when it already exists in osrs
There are many kinds of turing tests in theoretical CS, beyond the original
if you go to the original papers descriptions you can see what the purpose of the test was, its similar to bot detection in osrs
I never claimed certainty, only confidence/probabilities
for example the statement that the earth is round is for me still a probabilistic statement, its given that this is subject to some caveats and includes some error margin
well yes, see the "cartesian demon"
you can dissociate the client with quite simple experiments
for example when I was investigating entity poisioning of water sources
I ran concurrent bots and legit clients
and hand play and botted and image bots
anyway, this is going quite well, but I'm finding its getting stuck in some narrow corners sometimes
you run on neural networks, and the inputs to those networks come from sensory modalities, this allows some room for randomness
to the extent that the sensory inputs are dependent on truely random phenomena
I defined its previous position with a radius, so it doesn't immediately walk back on itself, there are some weird spaces ingame like
I am going to try and log the state of the machine
and figure out a reward/loss function
then adjust some of the parameters based on that and calculated rewards
first I need him to explore, then to interact with all entities, then with all npcs, then all widgets
so that I don't need to hand code anything extra
and it will learn and play itself
fatigue systems on entity interactions
I will pass it through an exponential
so its less likely to spam interactions
if the checks for tiles and entities/options are generic enough the bot could even survive game updates
without needing to patch the scripts
no because jagex change entity names etc and other stuff and move things
most scripts tend to rely on something hardcoded somewhere
I am reading all of them for the randomly selected entity
then selecting a random one regardless of what it is
i can link it to a radioactive isotope decay api
for which the function for decay is indeterminate
a function * trueRandomFunction = trueRandomFunction
I think...
maybe you can model the non random part
you're supposed to focus on something if you're trying to complete a project
in the DSM autism is more arbitrary focus on particular things
well if you're working ona  project, the details of that project aren't arbitrary
the common hyper focus in autism is on things that have no functional output, like species of butterfly etc
anti bot are a collection of largely statistical techniques
and ml models are underlain by statistics
the way to beat a complex profiling function is to create or generate an even more complex function
like how a GAN works
or a function that produces complex behaviour
like a bratienburg vehicle/automata
if they are linked to botting already than 30%
if not then 90-95%
there will always be error
and my experiments show that they don't require 100%
since you can be banned without even logging in
or hand playing on vanilla client
I have just written that script an hour ago
maybe once I have all the base game interactions and behaviours done
this is just one of my approaches amongst many
and java is not my language of expertise
it is already exploring the map
the brain reduces the environment to a grid anyway
the point is not to "discover" the map
but to perform animal like environmental exploration
you want the behaviour to emerge
instead of hard coding it
no no thats too low level and trivial
the algorithmic part of AGI isn't related to say an animals leg movements or the mechanism of a knee joint
spatial navigation is a sort of "thought" problem
thats why there is a return to nature inspired methods
I am modelling animal based exploration
the agents behaviour is at a high level
like the difference between a mechanical arm and a mechanical brain
osbots client is just the arm
the script is the brain
yes
but those are still low level
the brain integrates sensory input
it generates a high level representation of those sensory inputs
it is an endgame solution
the solution will be less effective in the early stages, but as it learns it will surpass those hard coded
its a paradigm shift toward 
so far yes, I need a working prototype with appendages and capabilities then I will log and build the learning
they begin randomly
you can have a proxy for ban data
and learn on that
if your loss function is human behaviour
and you optimize for it
you will optimise for anti ban
they were lying
jacmob is a confirmed liar
there is a video on youtube of it
yes
and who claims to have built the system
he claimed you can track a particular player logging in on a new account in another country
highly unlikely
he was making a ton of wild claims mostly I think to scare the younger audience into not cheating
there is a long list of jacmob lies
many of the claims he was making would be Turing award breakthroughs and he was throwing them out like nothing, and in the face of hundreds of 200m xp bots
and private services offering account training operating for years with impunity
it was when he made those claims
there are also videos somewhere of anti cheat claiming they know 100% if you're botting on a client
there is a development curve
and R&D doesn't usually immediately provide ROI
I have good estimates
is there an obvious way to track the outcome of game interactions? should I try and read all xp values and just track xp gain? or inventory item gain?
I'm thinking I should store the object + interaction string as a tuple, then compute the outcome, if its null then add that to a blacklist that will decay over time
I think I need to record the state, and the entity, the interaction option, then the reward measured in xp or GP, then from that I can create a probability to complete that action in that state based on expected reward
I need some kind of geometric surface to compute the probability on
The agent needs to fall into a saddle point, then come back out with some momentum
so he doesn't immediately fall back into the same again and instead traverses some kind of hyperplane
where xyz are the standard dimensions, A is an axial tilt, another generic dimension
A is the agent defined by its state, with M a momentum property that describes its movement across the plane
P are peaks that need more momentum to reach, T a troughs which require less energy/momentum
2a is a dimension on the surface, and describes the convexity of the function at that point, it is the second order derivative
hmm I think I need to track and store a series of interactions over time, then calculate the gain, because some things will be useful like widget interactions but not give xp/gp
its abstraction of the agents possible behaviour
it is the technical term
I struggle with java syntax because I write in hundreds of languages
It takes a long time to passively pick up syntax, even now to write a for loop in java I will still google the syntax and copy and paste it
this is an AI engineering project
because you will suppress normal production
and you need it for your normal circ rythms and homostasis
human body endogenously produces it
there is no medical evidence of effectiveness
semantics are more important than syntax
the more important language is theoretical physics
you will pick up the syntax as you build things, there are too many languages to bother to learn all the different parts explicitly without a use case
There is nothing I've not been able to "do", it just takes longer to look up the particular part of the API and understand how to phrase the code
if you write in a single language you don't understand programming
it is a kind of geometric representation of a phase portrait for a non linear dynamic AGI system
its more important to know what a for loop is doing that to have the specific syntax memorised
you can make a forloop from grains of sand
I don't think you need pointers in java
Like I c you need to handle them yourself
A stack is a kind of data structure
the programming languages supervene on theoretical physics
so their differences in syntax are somewhat arbitrary
more important is what they are doing at a lower level
I also code a QC
I use python to call it, but there might be a way to use java and implement it directly in your bot
I am doing some exploratory research
trying to find an algorithm to speed up computing NN calculations
if I solve that one I will load it on a supercomputer
run a bruteforce architecture search
on some of my other research
architecture/parameter search
try to solve AGI
It is private research
for profit
I read but I prefer to go from the ground up because its a new field 
not to reengineer the QC itself
but the higher level stuff yes sort of
most countries on earth can produce cars
but very few can produce self driving cars
in you guys custom clients can you see a stream of game data that represents the internal states/objects etc?
and do you have meaningful access to it
basically can you read the game state into a vector?
they changed osrs acc creation again
not sure what they've done but captcha has been repositioned, possibly upgraded fingerprints etc
possible site key change too
they are cheap to farm to the 3rd world too
there have been good attempts at automating just the image part with a  little nlp too
the captchas for osrs work out to about 0.002 cents iirc per captcha
4,700 gp per captcha
hi guys, I dnno if its ok to post here but I can't figure out why this snippet is throwing null pointer exceptions:
private int bfsTargetItemSlotHelper(Item[] invItems, int targetItemID, int startingInvIdx) {
20% of the time it seems to null pointer exceptions
my debug log reports this line            if (invItems[current].getId() == targetItemID) {
so 13 by yours
hmm yes I see that now. Now I think I am a retard, thanks guys
I still can't seem to prevent that null pointer, any ideas what to do?
@Qosmiof2 
yes but its still throwing a NPE
Here's the full code 
I can't use a breakpoint/ proper debugging because of the way my environment is setup
the NPE line is marked just under where I put //experimental fix,
and ingame it happens when trying to combine items sometimes, but maybe 20-30% of the time its thrown
> literally the first thing ppl told u lol
also thanks for trying to fix this its been driving me insane
you cant iirc, its an int, so it only lets me check if its equal to zero
but zero is actually a valid response
no that should be a long
because item IDs are longs I think
how can the slot be null? the slot wont even let me....
program 2 years M.Sc but java a month now
my osrs bot is pretty deep now but I didnt write this code snippet
but 0 is a legit index for the slot....? the slots are from 0-27
> InvItems[Current] != null
x6 out of bounds error?
and the second returns null?
well you asked item 2 for its id, which I guess will return null
getId()
not unless it handles nulls?
ok
but you can check it returns null
and then return something if it returns null
so it kind of does exist
ok but why would my index[current]
return null
its limited to 0 -27
then inventory is open
so in the code, the array is a linked list? bfsQ
so this should be null checked?
yeah
yes but I've allready null checked that in everyway imagineable
and its still throwing
if(invItems[current] !=null) {
I prefer to write code fast that works rather than spend ages saving a ms, for me the bigger picture is better than minute details that I can go over later
Well I built on it over and over, and dont really fully understand how to put snippets in different classes while using an API
that snippet is in a method at the bottom of the file...
my main finite state machine is about 400 lines and its very complex in its behaviours
that code I posted is one of a few snippets I copy pasted  to do something I CBA to code myself, thats also why I don't understand it
one class has 1k lines or so to simulate human typos.... it works, I call it with one line, I don't need to look at it  until it breaks
for me the people who spend extra time trying to optimize something unnecessarily are wasting time...
for so many things it wont make any real life difference to how fast it runs
well actually I intend to optimize my bots because I am running a farm
you could have given me the line for the null check
i mean the line for me to implement
90% sure its fixed, thanks guys
hi guys, wonder if anyone can help: I'm trying to consolidate my 3000 line bot into separate classes. When try to do this for methods that use the API for my client, I get "cannot be referenced from static context", so I make it static, but then i get "the non static method can't be references from a static context". so I'm stuck in a loop.
Thanks, I think i've fixed it!

anyone else running a suicide farm? for the past month, without fail my accounts are all banned from 7am GMT to 9am GMT, and they have a 20% chance of being banned between that time at 17:00 GMT
I can't be the only one to be getting banned at this time in the morning... its to the point where I can relaunch the farm pretty consistently just after the ban wave/chain and easily mule just before they are banned
Also, are area sweeps by jmods a thing? like they actually walk around ingame to locations and clear bots from each world there?
mine are all banned, everyday wihout fail at 7am 90%, and by 9am 100% are banned. I'm running about 40 on my laptop because I'm still in dev mode, can anyone recommend a VPS service with a "safe" ip that I could run 100+ from?
they are suicide accs... they are running 24/7 and their gp rate scales to max in about 30mins from acc creation
mostly I can run 40 or so for 23h before that 7am ban, then I one click relaunch
id rather scale the suicide op with a VPS, because my laptop cpu is pretty much at bottle neck
they are non stop suiciding on f2p... tutorial island to farm suiciding too and have a somewhat buggy chatbot that also begs nearby players for money
they delay bans and other obfuscation, so not necessarily
if they have a database with ips and accounts logged in from ip, and sort descending.... id be right up there. I don't think its worth it not to run at scale
ok i will do some next time I change my ip thanks
you guys who are lasting more than one day are taking breaks/not suiciding?
maybe you aren't lasting more than 24h in total
aha
I've already added a multi thread for the chatbot api and begging, I was thinking of adding a layer of anti ban whilst it does tutorial island
i mean anti ban over my tut island script.... because how else are they detecting it
to randomize more some of the actions by misclicking or something
people are getting banned
at 7am ban waves whereever my bots are are cleaned
that means nearly 100% of the farmers there are banned
botting something unpopular on p2p.....
you use a public client?
how long does it take to update your client if the break you with an update?
and why reverse by yourself when there are professional teams doing it like osbot/tribot etc?
so you guys are also claiming that other clients injection is detected but yours isnt....? this seems like bs
the only advantage to reversing it yourself is to avoid common detection.. if the major clients injection isnt detected....then why not use them and write private scripts with their fleshed out api
opinions on computer vision bots? I am planning on making a general one with tensor flow at some point, and a basic cog architecture
ive been suspecting jagex feed fake into to the client to trick bots based on hooks, a CV bot couldnt be tricked like this
in a video on old methods a guy claims in classic they used  a basic "click entity clicked x times, send fake entity"
well no, its just that we cant be sure they arent detecting injection/client hooks.... open CV seems the only way to pretend you are a human
lol jagex brought in a new trade limit for new accs???
now they need 10 qp or 24h for all items
they just ended my suicide botting career
there was already 7qp and some items, but I just sucided the other items
i can add a quest bot.... but this will waste another 2h or so of their startup time
they cannot last more than 24h
gold prices prob about to double
I imagine 90% of f2p suiciders are finished for a while
hi guys, sorry to ask again but I am hitting a NPE/ none type and I can't seem to fix it, 
if anyone has any ideas that would be great
you guys see the latest bot nuke update? all the f2p worlds are cleaned
> dude
sorry, the line throwing it is the one at the bottom, just under "click rock"
those objects are returned from the screen scan for the image, i guess they are coordinates for its position
also... I tried a free amazon trial windows private server and it fucking sucked, its real price is 10 dollars a month.... and I could barely run one bot on it without it lagging and being unuseable. Yet on my 2 year old laptop I'm pulling 40 at once quite easily.... can anyone recommend HPC/vps
i'm pretty sure the error says that i'm attempting to index a none object....which is self explanatory.... how exactly thats happening after I've checked that the elements in those lines are neither null nor 0 is my point of confusion.
the original source is here: I've modified this a bit iirc , but you guys might find it interesting, its capable of running on the legit and runelite client, using open CV to built objects to make states from, the guy has left almost 0 documentation/guide though and his ground breaking effort has been completely ignored 
I have dreams of adding RL or at least making a general exploratory agent with this forming the backbone of the agents sensors/sensory system RL algo, deep RL as its nervous system and a drift diffusion model for the activities selected from state models
its not a colour bot... realtime object detection.... it converts the images to greyscale I think too, and it can read text etc
guys i have an idea to run OSBOT on my GPU, I found this github and at a glance it doesnt look too difficult 
if it worked decently well maybe HPC supercomputers could be used to power a botfarm
not for data science...
just to run a JVM
instead of using the cpu, use a gpu
I tried most clients/apis, osbot beats them all by a mile
yes but I'm using my CPU already for botting
and my GPU is sitting idly by
also if it worked well.... there are HPC GPU resources 100000x larger for high physics and AI available
there isnt really good evidence that mouse movements are used to track botting
there are plenty who use snap to bots for months....
i doubt that....
make a bot that has absolutely 0 human mouse and super speeds...
you can still run it for 24h +
no good evidence
I saw that post
hes just speculating
50ms he claims
test it... run your bot with no mouse movement
that literally simulates impossible mouse clicks... same ban rate
re read that post the guy did
he shows they are tracking a position, then another position right?
not the trajectory arc
for every point
fairly accurate isnt good enough for your ML profiling
you cant just guess the middle
the whole point of human vs machine is the middle arc part
the jmods are 100 IQ at best.... whatever ml they are using is meme tier
their bot detection is literally chinese workers manually looking at accounts
also 6h ago osbot updated their mouse movement
you can use ML on point and delay and point data to detect people at inhuman speeds
but you cant profile their movement
without the fuckign middle arc data
and guess the points in the middle?
what paper?
i'm aware of that osbot post
oh
tyvm
will read
simple tests disprove the mouse data theory entirely though
check out the guy botting to ahk max
....
make a suicide bot and use a free macro mouse input
theres no change to the ban rate, even moving at inhuman speed or directly injecting clicks
suicide botting 24h is good... you win if you get close to 12+
jugs are entity poisioned
its sub1h ban for interacting with the entity on a bot client
because some guy decided to run 10k jug bots
all day everyday
i think I have a video of it
the idea human mouse movements are hard to simulate is also wrong....
you can easily record and model your own then compare a bots performance against it
50m osrs
this is why the fountains are entity poisioned
my bot in this video is actually using a neural network
but only for its NLP
lol this paper
so jagex claim they detected 100% of the bots...
and they give us the  Kolmogorov-Smirnov test as the metric
so we can just run our mouse sim software against the same standard....until we pass it? or train a GAN to do it for us?
is anyone buying this BS that they have 100% detection.....
his source that jagex's bot detection is 100% accurate is.....jagex?
mouse movement is not even a remotely difficult problem
you can record a single guys movement from one point to another point then add any amount of noise....
done....
it works fine because half of the highscores are bots....
yes they do...
they move like the human they recorded it from
you could also record the same point 5x then take the average
and use those as bounds for your noise param
"Random noise on a path won't look human will it" yes.... it will?
ok enough from me about mouses, my theory is that jagex pay chinese sweatshop workers to manually review and entity poison flagged accounts or accounts that have been playing more than 2h (no human is likely to be doing this except a few hardcore known players with 10y + gametime)
one single movement from point A to B and a noise variable is enough to break any ML detection
thats because of suicide bots
theres a paper on it
someones master thesis or something
lol trusting jagex
they have investors...
the paper showed is was more like 1h
and per week its like 4h per week
99.9% chance its a bot if they are over 4h in a week
you could pay a team of chinese to check each acc that exceeds that and ban them
They are almost certainly manually reviewing my suicide bot farms... to the tune of 10's of thousands of accs
the only way they are doing that is with 3rd world labor
maybe the same guys who fill in my captchas are also reviewing bot flags
that would be ironic
there have been a bunch of people automating ban appeals with 20-30% success rate too
they were doing that on huge farms....
there would actually
because those humans make mistakes
by attributing it to an outlier/autism
humans have systematic biases too
there are very few new players who play longer than 1h a day or more than 4h in a week
less than 50-100
one guy can review those by watching them
new players
if they have already tagged all existing human players
they only need to review new players
and ban anyone else they find botting in their current player stock
banning regulars who start botting is sustainable and doable
it takes a long time to get an acc to "main" status to bot something
its not worth gold farming with your main....
because getting banned means you worked for 0.00001cent an hour
pls report back to me
try varrok east
its where the guy ran the 10k farm
and lumbridge pvp world  is already disabled, possibly the same guy
my accs were getting banned within the hour, some less than 400 jugs filled
I get banned everyday, I suciide bot....
yes today
osbots api got broken temporarily and a few of mine got banned
because of it
I thought updates only come on thursday
I was in a skype work meeting and I started to notice my clients self terminating
its great
they patched it in a could of hours
like i said, ive tried a dozen botting clients and osbot for me is my choice
maybe i'm biased because i spent time programming with it but tbh its great
tbh who is botting and not farming....
my suicides are at 27h runtime ban average
thats up 8h since the last bot nuke update
i think i have a solution from that mccracken paper
if we have the function for the human mouse movements
we can generate the next movement with noise and use a container for the distribution according to the function
if our generated, next move doesnt perturb the container too much it passes and is executed
so we always move according to the human movement function
like random number generation according to a given distribution
you can diverge....
whatever method they are using if any (i think they arent at all because mouse teleport bots are hitting 99s) would be beaten by a human distrbution
also i've come back to my machine and found my bot clicking the same spot /entitty for a solid 14h and not been banned
no because he only works 12h
then he needs to go to his second job
sometimes he wont make it to your acc
from the major public clients its api is clearly the best
i think jagex fired half their chinese anti cheat team after the last bot nuke
they actually just put a trade limit on new accounts
no idea why it took them 10 years to do that
jugs are 60gp each now
the well is literally entity poisioned
anyone know how he managed to stack 100+ accs on the same world?
i highly doubt he used proxies and he had 100s on every world I bothered to check
you get blocked at 10
he has 10k proxies?
they are hard enough that i dont even have one
my iq is double didgits!!
those are all blocked/not working on osrs
and there isnt close to 10k +
ah well hed need 1k...
i counted 100 + on each world I checked
if he did every world,,, even just a that fountain
he could have been doing other fountains too
i think its much more likely he found a way to log more tahn 10 accs same world
risking serious jailtime for a water bot....
can get snatched by the cia for that
you can get extraordinary renditioned for cyber attacks on the us
no they dont lol
look at the last few guys they executed extrajudicially
bot net....
bot net from russia is a cyber attack
it falls under act of war
and terrorism
the US will drone strike/rendition you for a botnet
ignorance of the law is not an excuse
nigerians arent russians/chinese
the US has a major hardon for the chinese/russians
if you botnet and they trace it to there it goes to the military.... not the fbi
they can
they have executed hundreds of them??
US offshore prisons are filled with chinese/russians
plenty of arabs too
none of whom were extradited legally
over a botnet...
it doesnt matter what you are using it for
only that you penetrated machines in the US, and it came from china/russian. its in the new trump cyber warfare law
if you run a botnet overseas, especially a hostile nation you have comitted a an act of war in the 4th sphere of battle, cyber space
its literally called that
they declared cyberspace after land air and sea
they have done thousands of them..........
what is guantenemo.... its just one of them
one guy spent 5 years in jail for a RS comment
if you see the allegations for most of the non arabs in US foriegn prisons
50% or so are related to computer crimes
and many of them are incidental, like writing code that was used in some one elses act of cyberwar
there is no trial or formal charges if the US picks you up outside their border too...
the average botnet has 50k + machines infected
i cited my sources.... what i'm saying isnt controversial
the wiki article shows the laws i was talking about
and the term cyberspace
The United States Department of Defense recognizes the use of computers and the Internet to conduct warfare in cyberspace as a threat to national security, but also as a platform for attack.[1][2]
the cia dont arrest terrorists lol
you go to a black site
or get drone striked
gary mckinnon is i think the only one to do it and not get caught by them
and because he has the explicit protection of the UK govt
international incident?? they have drone striked 1000s of their own citizens living overseas
there was no incident
they have unlimited powers and budget for terrorism/warfare.... so yes they literally do pursue russian teenagers
have you seen the russian news? every day they are claiming the US has done xyz
look at what they got picked up for
its stuff like running botnets....
the nets are also amplifiers for attack vectors, about half of the public cyber threat list are amplifed/catalyst by botnets...
you think the us wont pick you up in china or russia?
if the host nation doesnt give you up then send jackals and you get black bagged... they even got caught doing it in france, a supposed ally of the US
wat...
mb, it was related to irl antiban
anyone got any code optimization tips specifically for JVM /finite state machine OSRS bots?
I'm also wondering if in delay conditions where I know there is at least a guarenteed 3-5 second wait time, if it would improve speed by using a thread sleep, then calling my conditional sleep (Which uses polling/cpu cycles I guess?)
And can anyone confirm that a single boolean check is negligible in terms of adding to cpu load whilst polling?
I think ticks are handled by the API in my case
I am just handling reaction time/cognitive load delay and game event delays
my query is whether most of a delay can be replaced by putting the thread to sleep to free cpu resources for other bots?
most of the delay for the logic is handled by an API that I can't really access or control, the delay that I'm trying to replace with thread sleeps is determined by large several second guarenteed when the cpu can be idle on a thread
if its not idle, I think its polling continually using up cpu cycles unnecessarily
some idles guaranteed can be as long as 5 seconds, so server ticks are irrelevant
also if anyone programs professionally in Java...what % cpu reduction would you expect from a poorly optimized code to reasonably optimized
but its typically 1-2% or 60-150%?
anyone know of a fix for intellij hanging whilst typing code? its not my machine...
hi guys, I've just almost fully automated my farm, however each account is inside a jar, and I track them on my servers by their jar and cmdline used to launch
they are supposed to destroy their own jar process when they get banned, but sometimes this fails
so the jar is still running but the account is banned... sometimes I can look at the cpu/memory in wmi task manager and see its really low so hes probably dead
but sometimes the cpu/memory is still as high as the other non banned accounts... so well... any ideas how I could detect the account is banned?
ideally not involving databases
or a way to easily try to "ping" an ingame acc to check if hes dead
on the client i use it reads that and tries to system exit then the script stops, but sometimes it fails
id have to do that several times a day... and the interval inbetween would be lost productivity
my theory is that the script that calls it sometimes exits before that system exit call because of some override in the API
i think i can do it if I could ping an account,
whats a tutorial island>receivebond>500k-1m hour method? that has an stable market like cballs/dragon bones?
also anyone know how I can sell a rs3 yellow
cballs 200k/h according to wiki
flax is 100k?
fletching needs 55 to profit and then its 170k p/h
gente, socios
tenemos una gran problema
este problema se llama sir pugger
Este bastardo va a destruir todo lo que hemos construido.
I  propose we do something about this problem
In less than a week from today jagex will crack down again
in direct response to this new video
ok i have a solution
Tengo una solución
collecting feathers is entity tracked/posioned
i think everything a genuine new player would visit is poisioned, so stay away from lumbridge and most of varrok
they said they even blocked splashing because newplayers would wonder why there were lots of players doing no damage to rats
they blocked the fountain lumbridge because of that too in part and in part because of puggers video
wtb proof
back in the day it was 5b a day with a small farm
can anyone share the account creation "site key" for selenium-gcaptcha
here is the url 
i'm trying to get it, apparently it doesn't change too
thanks 1,000,000
?
python account creator
i can get the solved captcha from anticaptcha, then supposedly that line near the bottom injects the response into the page
then i click verify, but it doesnt work
I asked the support at anti captcha.... the guys response was we don't know how to use the solved responses
# Inject response in webpage
im using python
requests seems much more complicated, and difficult to check/confirm the acc creation
anyone know what the new tutorial island configs are?
it seems they added a new case along side 281
hmm its the actual game
there is a scenario /server interaction between set name  and customize character thats failing to increment the config, yet you have advanced the stage.
the config then stays stuck on 0 for the whole of tutorial island, yet you can progress....
its tied to the account too, and can't forseeably be refreshed/reset
because there is no way to go back to the set name screen to trigger the config increment once you have a name
poor coding on jagex's part or config poisioning... hmm
on sythe probably
anyone know the config change at the start of tutorial island? after talking to the guide
that value is also 0
when he tells you to go through the door
sometimes i catch a change in config after selecting a name, then its fine using that
but sometimes that value doesnt change and i'm stuck, as 281 still returns 0 but he wants me to go to the next section
wait sorry that config is returning 60
ill check it out thanks
but my bots have been going for months using 281
how could they work without even using these values wtf is happening
i can see this one changing, i will try and write using it
when was that released....?
really...?
not sure if troll
this might explain the stack of dozens of accounts trying to talk to the guide
err thanks ive made some progress
this was for anti bot?
i check the update page and they say its a surprise/top secret content not anti bot
my fix so far just checks which one is returning > 0 then returns that instead
thanks guys
> @sarahpeterson 
why do they anti rwt so hard?
gold is 5x lower and the game is afkable and no one plays it
the people buying gold are also the kind of player jagex want
infact if you arent buying gold you're almost a net drain on jagex
gold buyers also buy spins to win, p2p in cash etc
anyone know of any self learning osrs bots?
with stuff like spontaneous exploration
on osbot you have the map coordinates and all the tiles mapped out, and the bot knows it own position on the map, it can read scan the entities around it and actions too and record gold in inventory/bank
if the data was fed from hundreds of bots and some kind of optimize for gold production with measures of the bots lifetime before ban
they could be left to suicide and swam learn
swarm*
i think most of the code is already written in osbots api i'd just need to tie it together and work out that function
even if the data gathering and processes is huge, it could be centralised to one NN, then all bots use that same network to decide their next action, eventually everything would also be precomputed in the network too once the initial pretraining is done
if the bots way of working out possible actions is general enough it could even learn around new updates with no intervention
not enough
but enough to be worried about pugger
wtf is happening to gold prices too... is there a twitch prime exploit?
why?
In some industries, men are killed for their "journalism"
ml updater?
are cluescroll bots a real thing? do they actually make decent GP?
to find dead in the water bots
mine seem to have their memory taken over until they are around 400mb if they've died but not self terminated
making tools to manage the farm in python and find stuck/dead bots from their memory values, then launching them in debug mode with interface so i can see whats going on
i think bots getting stuck is actually a ban trigger now, like it sends a flag to jagex
and if a guy is online he will check your account
which explains getting stuck for 16h and no ban because they have no one online to review
at my threshold now of 530 mb i'm catching all my stuck bots
i just kept going lower if the bot wasnt stuck
i tried and failed miserably at setting up server communication
i will try again at some point lol
they are supposed to timeout and attempt a restart which seems to fix it if I do it locally but for some reason they aren't responding to the timer... idk why and even when I tried to self terminate them if they were stuck they also ignored that
the client's not dying, in this particular case im debugging its my own low iq scripting thats causing the stuck
i have a two click kill launch test relaunch now in python
i think if i search for cpu util i could find NPE's too but I've resolved all of those in my script i think
you guys presumably use some high level language to manage your bots though right? this forums not for database/server etc management too?
also i'm not talking about script/bot settings....
Idk why you guys get so mad about OSbot... its not like any custom client has a fully built out API thats comparable
its really quite useful to outsource part of a solution to a 3rd party expert.... its not like you develop your own OS too right
its stuck due to script error
its the tutorial island gate on the new version, i built my 2nd version ontop of the same state machine for the first
osb client starts at about 400mb ram, then after maybe 10h it peaks at 1600
it doesnt need that extra though because if you use msis ram free it clears it back to 600 or so baseline
someone redpill me on pagefile? if I max the ram out can I still basically run bots from page file memory since osrs is so basic and doesn't need really fast memory performance and the pagefiles on a 970 evo ssd? would i ever hit a limit loading bots on ssds and expanding them into the pagefile spread across dozens of ssds/hdds?
i thought an ssd is loaded for 100 years
hmm but will the client actually give out running on a pagefile?
i think i played it on win 95 and dialup
ahaa
ty
i'm having heat problems on this machine and already running a lot of ram on it, i also have 10s of tb HHD/ssd space thats not really being used
it would take too much time
not worth it
My expertise is in high level programming/AI.... cog archs etc
to make a packet bot or something is probably quite trivial but it would take me a long time and id need a lot of debug
then id have to maintain it as rs updates which would really make it not worth my time
and face getting blocked out by an unexpected update
i think if anyone really has a packetbot we would see a lot more bots
was it a nuke? osbot is down
this is the number of players per world without bots
thats 10 bots for every real player normally
the md5# algos?
we need to try biological solutions
how long does it take to update hooks?
anyone still in doubt that 90% of online players are confirmed bots?
look at online players rn
its 90% less than it was 1h ago
and 50% of those are colourbots/ahk
1h ago world 430 had 800 players on it
right now it has 40
and at least half of those are ahkcolour bots
yes. and it had 800 players
1h ago
now no injection it has 40
half of the US are mexican now though
why sometimes they break the hooks? and sometimes not...
anyone using runeite would just load the official client...
w 430 is still 70 players
and half of those are ahk bots
half the f2p worlds are about 40 online players
they are all normally 400+
with runelite updating their method, will bot client devs just copy the method?
ah
its obfuscated too?
d...does jagex give them a special instruction set with identifiers too?
well because they could supply them with a key or method that identifies the client to aid their bot detection
5h for osbot devs to rehook their client wtf
people who manual play/bot or bot a main are their main customer base
wc
5h is bad no?
if runelite did it in 1h
its back up now, but that was a full 6 hours downtime
anyone know a way to stop java producing sound/mute it permenantly?
each new java instance by default has sound enabled requiring me to manually mute it...win 10
got ban waved that reached into a ton of accounts that have been created but not logged in
2nd time I've confirmed it, seems manual
the guy who does the 7am GMT wave I think did it
workarounds, experiences?
how to inject gcaptcha response into chromium puppeteer non headless?
using pythons puppeteer
in one of notabots videos he shows his farm manager has an integrated (i think python) GeeTest captcha solver which is completely done by machine, a quick google mostly turns up very old deprecated attempts. Anyone know if its really been done?
oh god jagex changed the name of something silently in the last update I was using to bot, it's really specific, does that mean they are onto me?
could they have done this to poison the entity too? is there some way I could check what the original object ID was?
is there an entity database like for items?
why would the change the name of the entity...? it's really just to break my bot until I notice and change the string? ...
anyone familiar with how entities are instantiated in the client? I am wondering if there is space for them to contain/trigger booleans or other information, or be "marked" or "poisoned" like this
in the object there could be additional fields etc?
its specific to particular entities
which makes me think that its hiiden inside the field that defines the entity
they literally broken my bot by changing an entity name today in a silent update... the entity has been the same sink 2004 or something
that doesnt matter, it was changed today
my tests on a poisoned fountain a few months ago strongly suggested that it was entity poisoned too
and I've recently discovered another similar entity poison
I have it down to the narrow range of interactions on this one too
its not the bots because I can trigger it playing on the official client
and hand playing
but doing what my bot would be
yes
i triggered the entitty poision
yes
this is also how I know that at least one of their detection methods is blind to client etc
since I wasn't even botting and was banned just the same as if I was
the kind of ban that hits a legit player on legit client not doing anything wrong, means that they wern't looking for mouse/client etc
just entity poison triggers
this was less than 45min playtime too
the first one I discovered was the varrock east fountain
then the centre fountain
then the GE fountain
they removed the pvp one
and poisoned those other ones
but it banned me the same playing on the official client, hand creating acc, tutorial
yes
yes and my ip was probably flagged too
but only the jug fountain interaction triggered it
i could bot other stuff and nothing
the entity has several fields
they could have one that can be flipped on flagged IPs
or targeted accounts
or a hidden depletion of an integer inside the entity
in a hidden field
but its those specific fountains
there are other fountains that aren't posioned
those ones are really visible
and for a few months a guy was running a 100acc per world 1b a day farm on the varrok east one
he had a solid line of accounts from the fountain to the bank
on every world
this is the data osbot client shows too
but maybe there are hidden fields too?
thanks for the solution
they can change the ID though too
my bots interact with thousands of different entites
I usually babysit the tutorial after update hours... but beyond that
I guess if they moved the entites you would break though right?
but they dont really do that
its the first time they've changed something like that on me
I have literally just changed the string in intellij to search...
the string is a different english language word all together.... like dog to cat
this adds 0 quality of life, i'm sure the guy who changed it is also targeting me
I am looking at the entity in the official client too...
the name of the object is different to what it was yesterday
and has been since the start of osrs
the thing they changed is the only one of its kind I know of, so its pretty rare, they 100% changed it silently in the latest update, I remember thinking the name was strange when I wrote the code, I knew exactly where to change it to update it... and its 5 seconds in intellij... so if they were targeting me, this was a poor way. Unless they have done that as part of an entity poison.
I've got all the flags set on options
and I edited the cdc in hex editor
tried undetected chrome selenium too
using chrome
gave fake headers
i had one but its recently gotten broken
seems like everyone else is down too
I think I've been investigated and they are patching all my methods
The new weath has really gone the extra mile, there are a ton of anti bot features on the new website too
they are using a basic anti colour bot on the account screen, and imperva throws some kind of mask over the page after the first page to throw a macro off
maybe gold is will make a comeback, there is osrs STEAM now too
oh maybe just rs3
the economies are linked though
like the euro and the dollar
70% of CS grads do not land a CS job
Guys I can confirm there is a working fix/crack for incapsula
4 months + and I have done it, so there is at least a way
still no known selenium crack
ugh guys I found some useful information
'Data Scientist
This is the first evidence I've found of jagex using ML, but it may just have been exploratory research and they still have nothing implemented
in anycase, adversarial model poisoning might be a solution
*from cambridge to google...
also deepmind are mostly focused on videogames too
very strange jagex were looking at NLP/sentiment analysis... this was for profanity filtering? or chatbot/farming bot detection?
I am putting pins in my prog before I run a drag net to scrape some stuff I need for a bot
it's interesting, perhaps a lot more couple be found by looking up ex employees
maybe they are dumb enough to have open repos of code they used there too
anyone an expert on "boosting and random forests", I suppose just for classification
if they are running live ML models they can be poisoned with adversarial attacks
and also tricked too
their director of datascience has just a fake certificate that takes 1h on coursera
they had this guy for nearly a decade
with an arts degree
doing their bot detection
That first one I posted is probably the biggest advance in ml they had, unless she was just lying about montecarlo forecasting
jacmob is a fraud and admitted liar
normally datascientists have bs+ms+phd from a tier one, like the first woman
instead they have a visual artist doing bot detection for nearly a decade
there are other kinds of bots though
I think writing a few sql queries will find 90% of bots
they run a sql query and return the new accounts by account created date
then go through them, and all the new accounts are screened first
they do do something like that
they even mentioned in a tweet they have some 20h or so heuristic
saying they were surprised someone got around the 20h
hans tells you your playtime...
they are tracked it ingame anyway
I doubt this is suicide...
I thought that was days
maybe you're flagged for review but they have 200k ahead of you on the list to review
they can track playtime /accs per ip
its just a simple query
I'm guessing they hold everything in sql tables no...? the entire HS system too
well does it work...?
and why are you relying on a player doing the reporting...
why not scrape the highscores data and run your own ML model tracking xp gains then reporting like that?
this is really inefficient, most players will never even come into contact with each other, and requires manual tagging. A ML clustering like k means could grab virtually all bots in a weeks worth of scraping the highscores login/play time and xp gains
lots of people are hiding their bots too and logging out based on wide tile searches so they have logged out before they are even visible to a real player
since you can detect the entity well before they are visible
also that tool isn't doing anything jagex don't already have access too and aren't already calculating
its not free for jagex since they are still manually reviewing
I was checking linked in and they have a datascience team
with at least one phd cambridge comp bio who developed some models
the point of ML is that it will over time be cheaper
jagex already calculate that same data...
almost all new accounts are 80-90% bots
jagex's own numbers show a new account plays on average 4 minutes then never again
40 minutes for less than 10%
and something like 0.002% for more than a weeks total in 6 months
virtually all new accounts are going to be bots once they hit 1-2 hours
and jagex already run analytics on those accounts for retention
thats why they sweep those lumbridge areas of bots because they find new players go there
go to google
search "linkedin jagex datascience"
I found at least one person with ml skills who ran a 9 month project
until I saw that I thought jagex were just offloading everything to a 3rd world team of indians manually banning
most of jagex's staff can't code and have highschool level maths
but this one is serious
no lol
probably under qualified
all cambridge phds are dphil
even STEM
to run a novel datascience project at scale it does require a phd
if anything she was underqualified for the position
this is faux datascience
you're talking about taking statistics
or data analysis
or running some random ml model
running a linear regression in pandas is not a datascience project
No real datascientists are under 40 also
anyway the point is that is pretty definite proof jagex are using ML
they claimed it back in 2012
but I think they were lying
once again a 5 year old can press run on the console
it doesn't make it datascience
this is exactly what they have been doing, my data shows it
they are also running some basic precanned SQL statements
I guess they have a dashboard
so the indian guy they hired doesn't even need to write the sql syntax
I have reversed their algos and models
and internal operational structure
with my own datascience
I have a very good idea
It's a working model, with error margins of course
you can probe their detection vectors with adversarial attacks
and by heavy logging of data
and running suicide farms against them
its a datascience project
its not a single model output
like you get on your kaggle projects
you would use systematic variation
and logging of parameters
no one over 50 is relevant in cs
My server works now actually
I almost have automated ML running on the sql data
instead of the text files I have storing most of the logs
It took one day actually
data stored in sql database
I store the commands in python juypter notebook
high level apis are for people who can't code
and are a crutch and limiting
you should be as close to the machine code as possible
It's much cleaner now and can almost cut logs and bank at draynor
I'm using this for each ground items, inventory objects, npcs, and will maybe add player characters and interface/widget options
just replacing the "get all"
its from osbots api
variable names should be expressive and not need comments
variable names, functions, class names etc
because it wasn't throwing on the null check
because I think its looping over an array of strings like [null, null, null]
so they are strings of "null" not actually null
either way I double checked
and it works now, it returns a random non null entity with non null actions
the original call returns 5k objects, and most of those have [null, null, null] options
I think its needed
the actions are read in as "null" strings
not the keyword
if (!onScreenEntitiesArray.get(i).toString().equals("null") && onScreenEntitiesArray.get(i).toString() != null) {
what if converting it to a string would produce null?
and if you mess up once it will crash your 48 core machine
I guess thats what I was thinking
I was trying to pass on loads of arrays I had fille dwith [null, null, null]
so I tried everything
ah yes I see now
I can just switch the order
ok can anyone help with my theoretical problem
how to build a loss function
I am thinking to read xp gain
and inventory item value
and to assign a score to each (entity, interactionString, lossFunctionValue)
then I can parameter search using those values
like GP gain
or xp gain
yes
I already have the first part of the tuple anyway
I just need to compute the outcome
but what outcome measure should I use
the first one is conditional
then I want a guarenteed sleep
then I want to measure the gain/loss and store it in a tuple
I think I need to record the "agents" state, and put the values in some kind of data structure
what structure should I use, I guess I could put things like camera orientation, coordinates, item ID values or strings
then in my tuple have an agent state, and the loss function
and the random interact
I'm doing some exploratory research into the banned of non botted or very minimally prepared accounts, nothing to report yet
maybe, but I am applying it, so for the most part its not so good to release it
also people will leak it to jagex
and uncover/patch more of my methods
the momentum is for the AGI research
it is like a parameter to move the statistical model forward by a step
if you go too small on the parameter it can be more computationally intensive, and you might get stuck in a local minimum
like your navigation unit getting stuck in a corner of the map
too large and you risk overshooting the basin of the function you're approximating and reaching an un optimal position on the surface of the function
if you're trying to find the lowest point and traversing the landscape
the momentum is how much you step forward
that is like an example of my idea for how to move the agent
you want the agent to have some maximum liklihood estimators for the complex function of acquiring gp/xp
to find those points in the multidimensional landscape you need to search the space
you take incremental steps and evalute
the AI hard problem isn't to do with moving the agent in the environment or handling sensory perception
its to do with the NN integration and algorithms in the neocortex
osbot handles the sensory perception, object classification, visual perception, motor movement etc
the unsolved problem lies in intelligently integrating that information
the human being isn't a hardcoded FSM
we need to move beyond those methods to better approximate human behaviour
osbot handles the reading of the visual landscape and pipelining to the central executive
like how the human visual system, eyes, nerves retina etc pass the information from the environment to the occipital cortex
but they don't "understand" that information
and cannot independently act intelligently with it
for that you need to solve the AI hard problem
yes, where the agent is, osbot returns the objects in his "view"
yes exactly
analogous to the human, the bot sees whats in front of it
but without the brain to understand that information
to then understand the game
it only blindly returns objects
like some of the lower animals without neocortex
they "see" their environment but do not understand it
when the adult human "sees" an object they are integrating that information and running distributed algorithms on it so that the human understands the object
I have some idea, but this is trivial
the information density in the neocortex is astronomical compared to the eye+retina+optic nerve
their system is supposed to not ban human players
the end game solution is then to simulate that human player
it may be that I will eventually need to switch to a python/openCV bot like screenclick AI
but this problem is trivial compared to the ai hard problem
it is trivial since you have "solved" it and so have osbot devs and many others
it is a known solution, like all of known mathematics is "trivial"
relative to the unsolved problems
Even Turing died without solving the problem
in technical terms the proofs he supplied are now trivial... since they are known
also they are tractable and we can check them
there are another class of problems
there is a scientific/mathematical meaning of that word
for me to implement Bernstein–Vazirani algorithm is technically trivial
since I can look it up and place the symbols
but for AI hard problems and those millennium problems.... they are not trivial
so similar to known/simple to implement, public knowledge, or would not require new breakthroughs in science/math that may not even be possible
something that was difficult to discover or prove may now be considered trivial, that its already been done
